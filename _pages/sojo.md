**12/3/21**
Orange sunrise, arctic cold of 15 degrees Fahrenheit (-9C) , and fresh snow started the big day. 6 years leading up to this special event with all of its funny memories, lucky coincidences, moments of support, true partnership and one of a kind kinda love. From the first site, to first kiss, to first child - both are always on each other's mind.  123...21 now announced husband and wife. Wedding bells are ringing - wait or are those jingle bells? Christmas is around the corner with fairy lights sparkling all over Oslo. Everyone who made it to the impromptu celebration put on a nice warm sweater, making it extra cozy. Thinking of everyone who thought of us sending wishes while abroad, filled our hearts - even duck hearts were involved that day, but that's a story to be told a different time. First enjoy the start of Jonnys and Sophiaâ€™s marriage while listening to their songâ€¦ press play, scroll down and thank you to be a part ðŸ§¡
