        <div class="tab-content">
          <p> Good evening everyone. My name is Jonny - Harry‚Äôs older yet <b>shorter</b>, <b>stronger</b>, and somehow <b>hairier</b> brother. Before I begin, I want to first say thank you to Audes Parents for producing a lovely Aude and helping arrange this amazing wedding. And thanks to my mom and dad for also producing Harry - a younger brother so close in age we are almost twins. </p>
          <p>Soooo Harry and Aude. Where to begin. </p>
          <h3>Aude</h3>
          <p>I want to first say Aude you look stunning and beautiful as a bride. That white dress really compliments you.  With all of the food and drinks we ate I am really impressed with how you have been able to keep it white. Harry you definitely found a winner.</p>
          <h3>Harry</h3>
          <p>As Harry‚Äôs older yet shorter, stronger and hairy brother, I will focus on speaking more about Harry - so Aude‚Äôs wonderful family can learn more about him.</p>
          <p>So when thinking about what to say, naturally I only wanted to share something embarrassing and felt like it wasn‚Äôt appropriate. So instead let‚Äôs focus on his best qualities - 3 specifically.</p>
          <h3>Harry‚Äôs 1st best quality: His big head</h3>
          <p>The first best quality is Harry‚Äôs big head - With his buttercream, buttercream, strawberry blonde buttercream velvety hair - making all the women in the world jealous.
          And inside that big head is just pure smartness. 
          He can learn anything he puts his mind too. 
          For example, becoming an expert in applying lube. - which I am talking about cycling of course - a hobby of harry‚Äôs. 
          If you have not checked out his lube job, I highly recommend booking a session with Harry. 30 minutes might not be enough.
          </p>
          <h3>Harry‚Äôs 2st best quality: His lonnng body</h3>
          <p>The second best quality is Harry‚Äôs longgggg body. When growing up we were inseparable. Everything we did, we did was together. On a daily occurrence, we were asked by strangers if we were twins. However, it got to a point in our childhood people stopped asking us. This was just around the same time I was putting socks in my shoes to sneak on roller coasters to pass the height check while Harry was passing the security checks in sandals. </p>
          <p>I secretly missed being Harry's twin brother.</p>
          <p>It's so good to be reunited here in France to use his long body as a platform for body surfing. But why is his long body his second-best quality? More surface area for hugging - even if that means I am nipple height, but I am not complaining, surface area for tickling, and lastly unearth all that surface area has grown the biggest heart.</p>
          <h3>Harry‚Äôs 3rd best quality: His big feet</h3>
          <p>So we have his big head, his long body and now comes to your last best quality, and you guessed it, his big feet. You know what they say about big feet right?? </p>
          <p>But Harry is in luck because he can wear the last size in crocks - making him a perfect fit for the Bechu family)</p>
          <h3>Conclusion of traits</h3>
          <p>So with all of Harry‚Äôs best traits out on the table, that big head, that long body, and those big feet, we all now can understand why Aude was charmed so much on the first site. And to be honest, knowing them both so well, they complement each other perfectly.</p>
          <h4>Lastly, as an older brother I am entitled to give some wisdom to my little bro.</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>First, If you ever get to a point where you want to sell illegal dvd‚Äôs, just don‚Äôt put your name on them.</li>
          <li>Second, Set goals. Move to Norway so we can be closer.</li>
          <li>Third, Never stop speaking your feelings. Aude, I feel hungry.</li>
          <li>Lastly, Never blame one another. Together you are an amazing team that can accomplish so much. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>With that said, cheers to the best little brother in the world and his amazing soulmate. Aude and Harry.</p>

        <div class="tab-content">
          <br>
          <p>Good Afternoon to all.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôm norm Griffin, father to this awesome groom! </p>
          <p>I‚Äôd like to thank both families and all the guests for attending today‚Äôs wedding ceremony and celebration. My wife thanks you, my great grandmother thanks you my cats thank you. </p>
          <p>And now a little bio about Harrisonn William Robert Griffin. He is the youngest of four siblings. Always known as our famil‚Äôs‚ÄùBABY‚Äô and his father‚Äôs ‚Äúmost favorite 3rd son!‚Äù So who is this groom? Well he‚Äôs all 6‚Äô4‚Äù, wears a size 16 shoe, and is 27 years old. Coincidently, he and Aude share the same birthday, February 7th. He is always on the cutting edge of new technologies, loves to cross-country ski, camping, rooting for Arsenal football, long-distance bicyclist (sometimes riding 40-50 miles in one jaunt). His love of animals was once again displayed when they adopted TorTor, a rescue cat from a local shelter a couple of years ago. He is now one lucky gato. During his 13 years in public school, he was an A+ student, and member of the National Honor Society, while also being awarded numerous other academic and achievement awards. Perhaps his crowning accolade was graduating as the valedictorian of his class in 2012. His love for school was also demonstrated by his superior attendance record to have only missed 4-5 days throughout 13 years. </p>
          <p>Another outstanding achievement that makes me proud to be his fater was him obtaining the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest award possible within the Boy Scouts of America. Only 1-2% of all boy scouts who enter scouting are able to acquire this admirable recognition. What else do I admire about this handsome groom. His whit, his intelligence, taught him to play the bass guitar (ps. He was the youngest student ever to play the guitar in the HS Jazz Band),
          obtaining his Bachelor‚Äôs and Master's degrees in Physics from Union College and McGill University, respectively; and with so many; more commendable exap.es would take me the rest of today to mention. Oh, I did forget his mushroom haircuts, opening presents on Christmas mornings, rock band RUSH, competitive swimming, Sunday School and so many more examples. </p>
          <p>And now, a few words about my son‚Äôs wonderful wife and my newest daughter-in-law, Aude Marie. To me, Aude is truly a God send to both Harry and our extended family. She is so true to her astrological sign as an Aquarian. She‚Äôs ambitious (ie. PHD inChemistry), and will express her opinion in a gracious and non-threatening way, Her great personal charm and sweetness make her popular around others. Also, I find Aude to be an exemplary cook while practicing a wholesome and nutritious diet for herself and us as well. Her homemade cinnamon buns are to die for. As a father, all I have ever wanted for Harry was to feel loved by a special woman. Over their years of courtship, I've witnessed a young intelligent, family-oriented woman with a big heart and the most compassionate attitude towards others. Here, I thought is a special woman that will love my son for all of who he is and for all the many years to come. </p>
          <p>I am so grateful that you have both found each other and can now continue to celebrate a lifetime of laughter, happiness and love together. </p>
          <p>In closing, I say to my marvelous son and my new wonderful daughter-in-law‚Ä¶.I will forever love you both! Congratulations and our lord pour out his blessings on you.</p>
